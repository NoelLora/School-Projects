CSE440 - Game Design
This was the game design project created by CSE 440 students Noel Lora, Marcus Valdivia, Zichong Wang, Bryson Anderson. 
Artists on the team were Roberto Cuevas and Faith Ramsay.

Story: Wally Watermelon(the player), moves to Eagle Rock, California to fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a fruit vendor. Eagle Rock is littered with hipster food vendors. The hipsters are using fusion flavors, while Wally just wants to share quality all-natural fruit. The hipsters feel their territory shrink so they decide to retaliate because Wally does not share their same vision. This leaves Wally with no choice but to get “yoked” and defend himself as he prepares to face the mean streets of Eagle Rock defeating bosses, and becoming the ultimate fruit vendor.
